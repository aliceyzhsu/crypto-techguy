# crypto-techguy
Some personal experiences and advice for tech guys in the crypto. Hope it is useful!

We are gonna focus on blockchain development and hackathon experiences. And this is an early version.

Currently we have:
- [resources](./resources.md): Collected some crypto learning resources you might find useful.
- [hackathon经验](./hackathon经验.md): Hackathon experience shared by [JH Chong](https://github.com/jhchong0405).
- [hackathon-resources](./hackathon-resources.md): Something useful for hackathons.

We will be actively updating this repo. Hopefully there will be more experience sharing and tech blogs in the future.
